Dear monem,
Kindly note that there are only 2 scenarios regarding ETA for CNX order 
1. If we are to proceed with CNX standard payment terms then delivery will be for Air freight from 12 to 20 weeks and for sea freight 16 to 24 weeks
2. CNX pays the CIF cost for their devices in advance and in return ABS will prepay their order in which as promised by Lenovo order will arrive in Egypt in 3 weeks and add to that an extra 3 weeks for customs clearance and issuing form 4 from the bank and final delivery for Air freight and for sea freight a duration of 5 weeks for custom clearance and issuing form 4 and final delivery

Subject: Clarification on CNX Order ETA Scenarios

Dear Monem,

I trust this message finds you well. I would like to provide clarification on the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for the CNX order under different scenarios:

If we proceed with CNX standard payment terms:

Air freight: 12 to 20 weeks
Sea freight: 16 to 24 weeks
If CNX opts to pay the CIF cost for their devices in advance:

Air freight: Prepayment will result in an order arrival in Egypt within 3 weeks, plus an additional 3 weeks for customs clearance and issuing Form 4 from the bank.
Sea freight: Prepayment will result in a duration of 5 weeks for customs clearance and issuing Form 4, followed by the final delivery.
Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Dear Masooma

I believe there’s a misunderstanding, as you stated, the monitors have VGA + HDMI Ports, however it is mentioned that VGA Cables is the one included and not HDMI.

Kindly note that we are keen on our business relationship with your esteemed company, thus as an exception ABS will procure the cables required and deliver them at our own expense.

Subject: Clarification on Monitor Cable Inclusions

Dear Masooma,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention a slight discrepancy in the information provided. While you mentioned that the monitors come with VGA + HDMI Ports, it is specified that VGA Cables are included, but there is no mention of HDMI cables.

Maintaining the positive and collaborative business relationship we value with your esteemed company, ABS is willing to make an exception in this case. We will take the initiative to procure the necessary HDMI cables and cover the associated expenses for the delivery.

Your understanding in this matter is greatly appreciated, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.

what is an RSA router and what are common brands that supply such an item
ChatGPT
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there is no specific type of router commonly referred to as an "RSA router." However, I can provide information on two potential interpretations of the term based on common networking and cybersecurity terminology:

Remote Access (or Secure Access) Router:

In the context of secure remote access to a network, a router with features that support Virtual Private Network (VPN) connectivity and security protocols might be loosely referred to as a secure access router. This could be a router used to establish secure connections for remote users or branch offices.
Rapid Spanning Tree Algorithm (RSA) Router:

The term "RSA router" could be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation. In networking, Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is a standard protocol used to prevent loops in Ethernet networks. However, RSTP is not typically associated with a specific router brand or model but rather a feature of networking equipment that supports the IEEE 802.1w standard.
If you have a more specific context or if the term "RSA router" has gained new meaning or popularity after my last update, I recommend checking the latest information from reliable sources or directly consulting with IT professionals and vendors.

As for common brands that supply routers with advanced security features or support for spanning tree protocols, some well-known networking equipment manufacturers include Cisco, Juniper Networks, HPE Aruba, Ubiquiti, and MikroTik, among others. Keep in mind that the availability of specific features may vary across different models within a brand's product lineup.

kindly rephrase the below email into a more professional one

Dear Vipin,

Good day.

As per your below email, I was informed that payment issue would be resolved as soon as possible, however it has been 20 days since I received your reply and till today, ABS has not received its required payment.

And when our finance department contacted Mr. Ahmed Mandour yesterday, he mentioned the issue was the fact that when ABS was registered on Nokia’s supplier list, the payment runs was set to weekly not monthly and that we should we communicate this with our point of contact

In addition I believe that we have all been working before these invoices were due that there would be a follow up to make sure payments were made in a timely manner both from your side and Mr. Hisham’s side, who has been very supportive throughout this whole issue 

Kindly note that Nokia’s failure to resolve this payment issue is raising a lot of red flags with our credit department which might affect our standing payment terms with Nokia, and with the amount of order to be delivered in the next coming weeks, this can be an issue and I am trying to avoid any issue that might affect our business relationship, however we do require this payment to be made before the end of this week

Looking forward to your feedback
ChatGPT
Subject: Urgent: Follow-Up on Outstanding Payment Issue

Dear Vipin,

I trust this message finds you well.

I am writing to address the ongoing payment matter concerning ABS and Nokia. As per our previous correspondence, it was anticipated that the payment issue would be promptly resolved. Regrettably, it has been 20 days since your last communication, and ABS has yet to receive the required payment.

Upon contacting Mr. Ahmed Mandour from our finance department, we were informed that the root cause of the delay is related to ABS being registered on Nokia's supplier list with weekly payment runs, instead of the agreed-upon monthly arrangement. Mr. Mandour advised that we address this with our designated point of contact.

I would like to emphasize the importance of timely communication and coordination between our teams, particularly regarding matters of payment. Mr. Hisham has been instrumental in providing support throughout this process, and I believe that a collaborative effort can expedite the resolution of this issue.

It is crucial to bring to your attention that the prolonged delay in resolving the payment issue is causing concern within our credit department. This situation has the potential to impact our established payment terms with Nokia. With impending orders scheduled for delivery in the coming weeks, it is imperative that we address and rectify this matter promptly.

I kindly request your immediate attention to this issue, and we are hopeful for a resolution before the end of this week. Your cooperation is crucial in maintaining a positive and uninterrupted business relationship between ABS and Nokia.

I look forward to your prompt feedback on this matter.

ChatGPT
The error message you're encountering indicates that there are undefined references to the symbol interactive in your code. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the interactive symbol is properly declared and defined in your code or, if it's supposed to be a function or variable from another file, make sure that file is included in your compilation.

Here are steps you can take to address this error:

Check Declarations:

Ensure that there is a proper declaration for the interactive symbol. It might be a function prototype or a variable declaration. Look for a header file or a source file where interactive is declared.
Check Definitions:

Make sure that there is a proper definition for the interactive symbol. This could be the implementation of a function or the instantiation of a variable. If interactive is supposed to be defined in another source file, ensure that file is included in your compilation.
Include Relevant Files:

If the interactive symbol is supposed to come from another source file, make sure that the file containing its definition is included in your compilation command.
Compilation Command:

Check your compilation command to make sure that all the necessary source files are included. For example, if interactive is defined in a file called utils.c, your compilation command might look like this:
Copy code
gcc -o my_shell shell_loop.c utils.c
Ensure that all relevant source files are included in the compilation.
Library Linking:

If interactive is part of a library, make sure that the library is linked during the compilation. You might need to add a -l flag followed by the library name. For example:
Copy code
gcc -o my_shell shell_loop.c -lmylibrary
Once you've checked these aspects, recompile your code. If you're still facing issues, providing more details about your code structure, including relevant parts of the code and your compilation command, would be helpful for further assistance.

From the code snippet you provided, it seems that the interactive function is being used in the hsh function, but its definition is not present in the code snippet. The interactive function is likely declared in another source file or header file, and that file needs to be included during the compilation.

To resolve the "undefined reference to interactive" error, follow these steps:

Check for the Declaration:

Look for the declaration of the interactive function in your code. It might be in a header file (.h) or another source file.
Include the Relevant File:

If the declaration is in a header file, make sure that you include that header file at the top of the source file where hsh is implemented. If the declaration is in another source file, make sure that source file is included during compilation.
For example, if the declaration is in a file named interactive.h, add the following line at the top of the file where hsh is implemented:

c
Copy code
#include "interactive.h"
Verify the Compilation Command:

Ensure that all the relevant source files are included in your compilation command. If the interactive function is implemented in a file named, for instance, interactive.c, make sure it is included in your compilation command. Here's an example:
bash
Copy code
gcc -o my_shell shell_loop.c interactive.c other_source_files.c
Check for Typos:

Ensure that there are no typos in the function names or file names. The names in the #include statements and in the compilation command should match the actual file names.
After making these adjustments, recompile your code. If the interactive function is defined in a separate file, ensure that the file is compiled and linked with the main source file containing the hsh function.

User

int interactive(info_t *info)

Certainly! Here's a rephrased version of the code:

c
Copy code
int isInteractiveMode(info_t *info) {
    return (isatty(STDIN_FILENO) && info->readfd <= 2);
}
In this rephrased version, I changed the function name to isInteractiveMode for clarity, keeping the functionality the same.

Certainly! Here's the code with the return statement split:

    int isTTY = isatty(STDIN_FILENO);
    int isReadFDValid = (info->readfd <= 2);

    return (isTTY && isReadFDValid);
}
In this version, I've split the conditions for readability, assigning the results of each condition to separate variables before returning the final result.

how to rename file in bash
ChatGPT
In Bash, you can rename a file using the mv command, which stands for "move." The mv command can be used to rename files by moving them to a new filename. Here's the basic syntax:

bash
Copy code
mv old_filename new_filename
For example, if you have a file named "file.txt" and you want to rename it to "new_file.txt," you would use the following command:

bash
Copy code
mv file.txt new_file.txt
If the new filename is in a different directory, you can specify the path:

bash
Copy code
mv /path/to/old_filename /path/to/new_filename
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to rename the file and that there is no existing file with the same name as the new filename in the destination directory.

If you want to rename multiple files at once, you can use wildcard characters. For example, to rename all files with a ".txt" extension in the current directory, you could use:

bash
Copy code
mv *.txt new_extension/
This would rename all ".txt" files to have "new_extension" as part of their filenames. Adjust the patterns and paths according to your specific requirements.
