 * jump_list - Searches for an algorithm in a sorted singly

 * @list: A pointer to the  head of the linked list to search.
 * @size: The number of nodes in the list.
 * @value: The value to search for.
 *
 * Return: If the value is not present or the head of the list is NULL, NULL.
 *         Otherwise, a pointer to the first node where the value is located.
 *
 * Description: Prints a value every time it is compared in the list.
 *              Uses the square root of the list size as the jump step.
